<p>
I was born in Southern California & practically grew up there my entire life. I moved to Arizona at a young age due to my fathers trade and i never really looked back. Although at times i miss
the sunny skies and smell of ocean water ive grown extremly attatched to the desert. From a young age i was always obsessed with technology. My mind always asked why and how whenever using any new tech products. 
i went from taking apart gameboys and cd players to dismanatling my home PC and rebuilding it with better parts. Computers and video games have been a huge part of my life. I began coding to help feed my obsession with learning new skills 
and hopefully one day build amazing websites or head-turning software. I'm ready to grow and learn in this industry.
